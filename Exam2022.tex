\begin{document}
\maketitle

We are going to make an S4 Package named \texttt{easyPois}. It will
require making multiple new generics and methods (specified below).

\hypertarget{rules-of-the-road}{%
\subsection{Rules of the Road}\label{rules-of-the-road}}

\textbf{Some notes}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I am expecting a complete gitHub repository containing the package and
  a development file. The development file should walk through the
  entire process of creating and documenting the package and include
  some example code showing how each function works. That is, you should
  provide some examples that make use of the functionality in the
  package.
\item
  You have until the beginning of class on Wednesday, April 13. I do not
  expect that this will take anyone more than six hours total, but you
  are allowed to space that six hours over any 8-hour period. This
  allows you to go eat or whatever. But if you are going to work the
  entire time, please limit yourself to six hours.
\item
  We will begin the time from the moment you start your GitHub
  Repostory.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{You will be graded on}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Comments
\item
  Correct/frequent use of GitHub with regular of commits.
\item
  Elegance of code (e.g., apply rather than loops, speed of
  functionality, etc.)
\item
  Readability of the code/stability of naming conventions
\item
  Documentation/full completion of package structure
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Practicalities}:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Email the TA with your repository when done. Include a start/end time
  in that email. Note any breaks.
\item
  If you are totally lost and confused, drop me a note on slack. But be
  aware that I am not always be available especially since I am at a
  conference. I will do my best. But you can also contact Ryan if I am
  not responsive. If you are in a total panic text me at 919-559-6255.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Notes}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Nearly the first thing I will do is test that your function gives back
  expected results. Make sure your function actually executes as
  expected.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{introduction-to-the-problem}{%
\subsection{Introduction to the
problem}\label{introduction-to-the-problem}}

In this exam, we will be working with the a one parameter likelihood
function for data we assume to be distributed according to a Poisson
distribution. Some of you have less training in probability theory than
others. That's OK. The goal here is to give you enough instructions to
complete the project with a limited understanding of the actual math or
statistics.

Poisson models are typically used in cases where the data (\(y\)) is all
count data. Thus, the data should be all positive integers (or zero).
For data point \(i\), we assume the probability of observing a value
\(y\) is:

\[Pr(Y_i=y_i) = \frac{\lambda^{y_i}\exp(-\lambda)}{y_i!} \] So if
\(y_i=2\) and \(\lambda=4\), then

\[Pr(Y_i=2) = \frac{4^{2}\exp(-4)}{2\cdot1} \]

The basic idea here is that we have \emph{observed} a vector of data
(\(y\)) and we are trying to \emph{estimate} \(\lambda\). Your goal in
this exam is to develop a package to estimate \(\lambda\) for a set of
observed data. Don't worry, we'll tell you exactly how to do it.

\hypertarget{details}{%
\subsection{Details}\label{details}}

\hypertarget{class-definition-poismle}{%
\subsubsection{Class definition:
PoisMLE}\label{class-definition-poismle}}

You need to define and S4 class that represents a fitted model. The
class should have room for the following slots.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  y: The original data
\item
  MLE: The maximum likelihood estimator for this dataset
\item
  LL: The log likelihood calculated from the observed data assuming the
  MLE is correct.
\item
  SE: The standard error for the MLE
\item
  SEtype: The method used to calculate the standard error.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{loglik}{%
\subsubsection{logLik}\label{loglik}}

You will make a \texttt{logLik} function that calculates a log
likelihood for the observed data.

The function should take in the following inputs:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{y}: The \emph{vector} of observed data
\item
  \texttt{lambda}: The assumed value of \(\lambda\)
\end{itemize}

The function should produce as an output:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The loglikelihood for the observed data conditioned on the value of
  \(\lambda\). Mathematically this is:
\end{itemize}

\[LL(\lambda)=-n \lambda-\sum_{i=1}^n\ln(y_i!) + \ln(\lambda)\sum_{i=1}^ny_i\]
where \(n\) is the number of observations.

\hypertarget{mle}{%
\subsubsection{mle}\label{mle}}

You will make a \texttt{mle} function that calculates the maximum
likelihood estimator for \(\lambda\). It will take in the vector of data
and output the MLE.

The formula for the MLE is:

\[MLE = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^ny_i}{n}\]

\hypertarget{standarderror}{%
\subsubsection{standardError}\label{standarderror}}

You will also make a function that calculates the standard error. This
will take in a vector of the data but also an argument for
\texttt{SEtype}. \texttt{SEtype} can take on two different values:
\texttt{basic} and \texttt{bootstrap}.

\hypertarget{basic}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{basic}}{basic}}\label{basic}}

If the standard error is basic, the function should return:

\[\sqrt{\frac{MLE}{n}}\]

\hypertarget{bootstrap}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{bootstrap}}{bootstrap}}\label{bootstrap}}

Here is the tricky part. If the user chooses the \texttt{bootstrap}
option you are going to calculate as follows. Let \(B\) be the number of
bootstrapped resamplings (you will have to set this or let the user set
it). You are going to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Create \(B\) samples from \(y\) where you sample \textbf{WITH
  REPLACEMENT} a sample of size \(n\) from the original vector \(y\).
  The result should be a matrix that is \(n\) by \(B\). Ask questions if
  this is confusing to you. Wikipedia is also helpful.
\item
  Calculate the MLE for each of these samples. So you will have a vector
  of MLEs of length \(B\).
\item
  Find the standard deviation of the results from step 2.
\end{enumerate}

The output of step 3 is the bootstrapped standard error.

\hypertarget{estimatepois}{%
\subsubsection{estimatePois}\label{estimatepois}}

The final function you will make will make use of the various functions
you defined above. It will take in data and return an object of class
\texttt{PoisMLE} (see above). That means it should return an object
structured like this and of the appropriate class:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  y: The original data
\item
  MLE: The maximum likelihood estimator for this dataset
\item
  LL: The log likelihood calculated from the observed data assuming the
  MLE is correct. (So you will put in the MLE for the lambda argument.)
\item
  SE: The standard error for the MLE
\item
  SEtype: The method used to calculate the standard error.
\end{itemize}

The user should put in the data (\(y\)) and the option for the standard
errors. You may want to include other options depending on how you
implement the functions above. (For instance, you may want to let the
user set the number of bootstrapped samples.)

\hypertarget{extra-credit}{%
\subsubsection{Extra credit}\label{extra-credit}}

For extra credit, create a plotting function for \texttt{PoisMLE} that
shows the MLE plus and minus 1.96 standard errors. Be creative.
