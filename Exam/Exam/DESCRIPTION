Title: Poisson Distribution Estimation
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Jordon Newton
Maintainer: The package maintainer <j.newton@wustl.edu>
Description: The package takes data and tries to estimate a poisson distribution, as required for the ASP2022 exam. There are 4 functions of interest: 
    logLik estimates the log likelihood given data and a chosen lambda
    mle provides the maximum likelihood estimate of lambda given the data
    standardError estimates the standard error, either with a basic estimate or a bootstrapped estimate
    estimatePois creates an object of s4 class "PoisMLE", which contains the data, the MLE, the log likelihood using the MLE, the standard errors, and the type of SE estimate used.
